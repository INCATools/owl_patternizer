  text: "The adventitia of %s (TS22-TS28). The outermost layer of the bladder is subdivided into serosa of bladder (TS22-TS28) and %s (TS22-TS28). Most of the bladder is covered by serosa, a serous-fluid-secreting outer epithelial surface of the bladder in contact with the coelomic cavity. The fundus (or dome) is surrounded by serosa, the rest of the bladder, in contact with the adjacent connective tissue, is covered by adventitia. The adventitia refers to the outer part of the bladder that is not exposed to the peritoneal cavity but is a connective tissue layer that binds it to the adventitia of adjacent organs. The proportion of the bladder covered by serosa and adventitia is stage dependant, with adventitia covering more of the bladder early in development, and the majority covered by serosa later in development."
