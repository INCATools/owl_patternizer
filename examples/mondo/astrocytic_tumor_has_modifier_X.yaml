  text: "A low-grade (WHO %s) astrocytic neoplasm. It is characterized by diffuse infiltration of neighboring central nervous system structures. These lesions typically affect young adults and have a tendency for progression to anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma. Based on the IDH genes mutation status, diffuse astrocytomas are classified as IDH-mutant, IDH-wildtype, and not otherwise specified."
