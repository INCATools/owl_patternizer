(CRMs can be located a few kb to hundred kb upstream of the basal promoter, in the coding %s, within introns, or in the downstream 3'UTR sequences, as well as on different chromosome). A single gene can be regulated by multiple CRMs to give precise control of its spatial and temporal expression. CRMs function as nodes in large, intertwined regulatory network."
