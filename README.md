# owl patternizer

Automatically extract common patterns from an OWL Ontology

Currently this only looks for equivalence axioms between a named class
and a class expression (aka logical definitions), where the class
expression uses the following constructs:

 - some
 - and
 - named classes
 - named object properties

It will generate out descriptions of the pattern in YAML following [DOSDP Schema](https://github.com/INCATools/dead_simple_owl_design_patterns/)

## Installation

There are two ways to do this

 1. via Docker
 2. direct via swipl

For 1, no additional installation required

For 2, you will need to install [sparqlprog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=sparqlprog)

## Command Line Usage



`pl2sparql -e -c conf/disorder_conf.pl -i tests/data/neoplasm.owl doall`


## Examples


### Anatomy

The following are entirely autogenerated:

 * [uberon generated patterns](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/tree/master/patterns/generated)

Config: [patternizer_conf](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/blob/master/patterns/patternizer_conf.pl)

TODO: this config only seems to be generating patterns with 1
variable; this may just be the structure of the ontology too.
